## 📌 Introduction

I am an Android developer with **10+ years of experience** in building production-grade mobile applications.

**Cinemy** is an **experimental project**, not intended for production use. Its purpose is to **demonstrate modern technologies**, including:
- Clean + MVI architectural patterns,
- server-driven UI,
- on-device ML for sentiment analysis,
- and MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration.

A key highlight of this project: it was **entirely developed using an AI agent system**.
- All code was generated by AI based on my prompts and scenarios.
- There is **not a single line of manually written code**.
- My role was solely as an architect and prompt engineer.

### 🤖 Local Model Training and Integration

For review analysis, a **custom fine-tuned sentiment model** was trained and optimized specifically for mobile use.

**Model and specifications:**
- **Base model:** `distilbert-base-uncased` (Hugging Face, v2.0)
- **Framework:** PyTorch → exported to ONNX → optimized with ONNX Runtime Mobile
- **Optimization:** int8 quantization reduced model size to **<1 MB**
- **Performance:** sub-5ms inference on mid-range devices
- **Training:** fine-tuned on movie review datasets (IMDB + custom sets)
- **Integration:** embedded directly in the Android project via ONNX Runtime, with **no external ML dependencies**

This makes Cinemy a **showcase of how an AI agent system, guided only by a developer’s prompts and scenarios, can build a complete Android application with integrated AI features**.

## 🤖 AI Integration

### 🧠 Local Sentiment Analysis Model

Custom-trained keyword-based sentiment analysis optimized for mobile performance with sub-5ms inference time and minimal memory footprint.

**Model Specifications:**
- **Algorithm**: Keyword-based classification with context boosters
- **Performance**: Sub-5ms inference time on device
- **Memory Usage**: Less than 1MB footprint

- **Specialization**: Movie-specific context understanding with intensity modifiers

### 🎨 Server-Driven UI with AI

The application receives AI-generated UI configurations that dynamically style components based on real-time movie content analysis. Colors, themes, and component styling adapt automatically.

### 🔗 MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration

Revolutionary backend communication through MCP protocol enables AI-powered movie data enrichment and dynamic UI generation. All backend interactions utilize this cutting-edge protocol.

## 🖥️ Backend Implementation

The backend for **Cinemy** was designed as a lightweight experimental setup to complement the mobile application.

### ⚙️ Technologies & Setup
- **Docker + n8n**: containerized automation platform with a dedicated workflow for TMDB API integration ✅
- **Ngrok tunnel**: secure public endpoint for local development and testing ✅
- **n8n Workflows**:
  - TMDB API data ingestion
  - Gemini AI integration for dynamic color scheme generation ✅
- **Data preparation**: Review data preprocessing for mobile on-device sentiment analysis was assisted using **Perplexity AI** ✅

This backend acts as an orchestrator between external APIs (TMDB, Gemini), local AI pipelines, and the mobile client — while remaining minimal and flexible.
