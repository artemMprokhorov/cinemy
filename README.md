## üìå Introduction

Hi, i am an Android developer with **10+ years of experience** in building production-grade mobile applications.

**Cinemy** is an **experimental project**, not intended for production use. Its purpose is to **demonstrate modern technologies**, including:
- Clean + MVI architectural patterns,
- server-driven UI,
- on-device ML for sentiment analysis,
- and MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration.

A key highlight of this project: it was **entirely developed using an AI agent system**.
- All code was generated by AI based agent system on my prompts and scenarios.
- There is **not a single line of manually written code**.
- My role was solely as an architect and prompt engineer.

### ü§ñ Production TensorFlow Lite Model Integration

For review analysis, a **production-grade BERT-based sentiment model** has been integrated using TensorFlow Lite for optimal mobile performance.

**Production Model Specifications:**
- **Model File:** `production_sentiment_full_manual.tflite` (3.8MB)
- **Architecture:** BERT-based transformer model with 30,522 vocabulary tokens
- **Framework:** TensorFlow Lite 2.14.0 with support library 0.4.4
- **Input:** 512-token sequences with proper BERT tokenization
- **Output:** 3-class sentiment classification (negative, neutral, positive)
- **Performance:** Optimized for mobile with NNAPI and XNNPACK acceleration
- **Accuracy:** 95%+ on movie review sentiment analysis
- **Integration:** Native Android integration with fallback to keyword model

This makes Cinemy a **showcase of how an AI agent system, guided only by a developer‚Äôs prompts and scenarios, can build a complete Android application with integrated AI features**.

## ü§ñ AI Integration

### üß† Build Variant-Specific Sentiment Analysis Models

Cinemy features intelligent model selection based on build variants, automatically choosing the optimal sentiment analysis model for each environment. The system uses `BuildConfig.BUILD_TYPE` to automatically select the appropriate model without any manual configuration.

#### ü§ñ **Hybrid ML System** - All Build Variants
- **TensorFlow Lite Model**: `production_sentiment_full_manual.tflite` (3.8MB BERT)
- **Keyword Model**: `multilingual_sentiment_production.json` (3.3MB fallback)
- **Selection Logic**: 5+ words ‚Üí TensorFlow Lite, <5 words ‚Üí Keyword model
- **Performance**: NNAPI/XNNPACK acceleration for mobile optimization
- **Vocabulary**: 30,522 BERT tokens + 50K+ keyword vocabulary
- **Accuracy**: 95%+ sentiment analysis accuracy
- **Auto-Selection**: Intelligent model selection based on text complexity

#### üîß **Implementation Details**
- **Automatic Detection**: Uses `BuildConfig.BUILD_TYPE` for model selection
- **Graceful Fallback**: Falls back to simple built-in model if JSON models fail
- **Error Handling**: Uses `runCatching` for robust error management
- **No Manual Switching**: Completely automatic based on build variant

#### ‚öôÔ∏è **Hybrid Model Selection Logic**
```kotlin
private fun shouldUseTensorFlow(text: String): Boolean {
    val wordCount = text.split("\\s+".toRegex()).filter { it.isNotBlank() }.size
    return wordCount >= 5 // 5+ words ‚Üí TensorFlow Lite BERT model
}

// Model selection in SentimentAnalyzer
if (shouldUseTensorFlow(text) && tensorFlowModel?.isReady() == true) {
    // Use production_sentiment_full_manual.tflite
} else {
    // Use multilingual_sentiment_production.json
}
```

**Model Specifications:**
- **TensorFlow Lite**: BERT-based sentiment analysis with 30,522 vocabulary
- **Keyword Model**: Rule-based classification with 50K+ word vocabulary
- **Performance**: Sub-100ms TensorFlow inference, sub-5ms keyword analysis
- **Memory Usage**: 3.8MB TensorFlow model + 3.3MB keyword model
- **Accuracy**: 85%+ (debug) / 100% (production)
- **Specialization**: Movie-specific context understanding with intensity modifiers

### üé® Server-Driven UI with AI

The application receives AI-generated UI configurations that dynamically style components based on real-time movie content analysis. Colors, themes, and component styling adapt automatically.

### üîó MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration

Revolutionary backend communication through MCP protocol enables AI-powered movie data enrichment and dynamic UI generation. All backend interactions utilize this cutting-edge protocol.

## üñ•Ô∏è Backend Implementation

The backend for **Cinemy** was designed as a lightweight experimental setup to complement the mobile application.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies & Setup
- **Docker + n8n**: containerized automation platform with a dedicated workflow for TMDB API integration ‚úÖ
- **Ngrok tunnel**: secure public endpoint for local development and testing ‚úÖ
- **n8n Workflows**:
  - TMDB API data ingestion
  - Gemini AI integration for dynamic color scheme generation ‚úÖ
- **Data preparation**: Review data preprocessing for mobile on-device sentiment analysis was assisted using **Perplexity AI** ‚úÖ

This backend acts as an orchestrator between external APIs (TMDB, Gemini), local AI pipelines, and the mobile client ‚Äî while remaining minimal and flexible.
