# 🎯 Cursor Integration Guide

This guide explains how to effectively use **Cursor IDE** with the Cinemy project, leveraging its AI capabilities and the comprehensive documentation structure.

## 🚀 Getting Started with Cursor

### 1. **Open the Project**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd Cinemy

# Open in Cursor
cursor .
```

### 2. **Understand the Documentation Structure**
The project uses a centralized documentation approach:
- **📁 `docs/`** - All documentation files
- **📄 `README.md`** - Main project overview (in root)
- **🔗 Links** - All documentation links point to `docs/` folder

## 🤖 Leveraging Cursor's AI Features

### **Code Understanding**
Use Cursor's AI to understand the codebase by referencing documentation:

```

@docs/guides/QA_TESTING_GUIDE.md What testing strategies should I follow?
@docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md I'm getting build errors, what should I check?
```

### **Architecture Questions**
```
@docs/guides/ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md Explain the data layer architecture
@docs/guides/ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md How does the presentation layer work?
@docs/guides/ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md What is the MVI pattern implementation?
```

### **Layer-Specific Questions**

## 🎯 Cursor-Specific Tips

### **1. Use @docs/ References**
When asking Cursor about the project, reference specific documentation:
```
@docs/guides/ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md @app/src/main/java/org/studioapp/cinemy/presentation/ How does the ViewModel work?
```

### **2. Context-Aware Development**
Cursor can understand the project better when you provide context:
```
@docs/guides/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md I need to add a new feature following the MVI pattern
@docs/guides/ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md How should I structure a new screen component?
@docs/app_layers/PRESENTATION_LAYER.md How should I implement a new ViewModel?
@docs/app_layers/UI_COMPONENTS_LAYER.md How should I create a new UI component?
```

### **3. Build and Testing**
```
@docs/guides/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md How do I build the dummy version?
@docs/guides/QA_TESTING_GUIDE.md What testing approach should I use for this feature?
```

### **4. Troubleshooting**
```
@docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md I'm getting this error: [paste error]
@docs/DEPENDENCIES_INFO.md How do I update dependencies safely?
```

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### **1. Project Setup**
```bash
# Follow the Development Guide
@docs/guides/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md
```

### **2. Understanding Architecture**
```bash
# Study the architecture
@docs/guides/ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md
```

### **3. Building and Testing**
```bash
# Build without leak detection
./gradlew clean assembleProdDebug

# Build dummy version
./gradlew clean assembleDummyDebug
```

### **4. AI-Assisted Development**
Use Cursor's AI with documentation context:
