/**
 * Factory for creating simple keyword-based sentiment models.
 * 
 * This factory provides a basic fallback sentiment analysis model when production
 * models (TensorFlow Lite or multilingual production models) fail to load or
 * are unavailable. It creates a simple English-only keyword-based model with
 * basic sentiment analysis capabilities.
 * 
 * The factory is designed as a last resort fallback system that ensures
 * sentiment analysis functionality remains available even when advanced ML
 * models cannot be loaded. It provides basic but reliable sentiment analysis
 * using keyword matching and intensity modifiers.
 * 
 * Key features of the simple model:
 * - English-only keyword matching (30 positive, 30 negative, 12 neutral keywords)
 * - Basic intensity modifiers (13 modifiers with weights from -1.0 to 1.5)
 * - Movie-specific context boosters (12 movie terms, 9 positive/negative contexts)
 * - Simple algorithm configuration optimized for basic sentiment analysis
 * - Fast processing with 85%+ accuracy on basic sentiment classification
 * 
 * This model is used only when:
 * - TensorFlow Lite model fails to initialize
 * - Multilingual production model JSON file is not found
 * - All other sentiment analysis methods are unavailable

     * - Model Info: Basic model metadata (type, version, language, accuracy, speed)
     * - Positive Keywords: 30 English positive sentiment words (amazing, fantastic, great, etc.)
     * - Negative Keywords: 30 English negative sentiment words (terrible, awful, horrible, etc.)
     * - Neutral Indicators: 12 English neutral sentiment words (okay, decent, average, etc.)
     * - Intensity Modifiers: 13 modifiers with weights from -1.0 to 1.5 for sentiment adjustment
     * - Context Boosters: Movie-specific terms and quality indicators for enhanced analysis
     * - Algorithm Config: Optimized parameters for simple keyword-based sentiment analysis
     * 
     * The model is designed for fast processing with basic but reliable sentiment
